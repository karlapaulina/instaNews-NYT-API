# Project-03

This is a one-page, responsive website that allows a user to filter top news story categories via NYT API.

Languages used: 
HTML5
CSS3
Javascript
jQuery

Personal learnings: 

Working with jquery functions, for loops, ajax, and if statements was challenging at the start, but working through the logic and writing them from scratch is more intuative now. 

Styling with SASS was great and certainly makes more sense work-flow wise.
